      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you’re eligible</h2>
      <p>If you can get New Style JSA, we’ll contact you about an appointment to agree what you
      need to do to look for work. This agreement is called a ‘Claimant Commitment’. We’ll
      usually contact you about the appointment within 10 days.</p>

      <p>The appointment will be with a work coach and will normally be over the phone.</p>

      <p>You must attend the appointment and agree your Claimant Commitment before we can
      pay you. Once you’ve agreed your Claimant Commitment and if you’re due a payment,
      we’ll aim to pay you within 7 days.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you’re not eligible</h2>
      <p>If you cannot get New Style JSA, we’ll send you a letter to explain why. 
      We’ll usually send the letter within 10 days.</p>

<p>If you're on a low income you might be able to apply for Universal Credit as part of a dual claim with New Style JSA.</p>
<p>Unlike New Style JSA, you can apply with a partner and get support for housing costs, children and childcare.</p>
<p>You or your partner must have less than £16,000 in savings or investments to be eligilbe.</p>
