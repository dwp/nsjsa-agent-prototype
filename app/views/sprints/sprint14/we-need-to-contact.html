      <p>If you're on a low income you might be able to apply for Universal Credit as part of a dual claim with New Style JSA.</p>
      <p>Unlike New Style JSA, you can apply with a partner and get support for housing costs, children and childcare.</p>
      <p>You or your partner must have less than Â£16,000 in savings or investments to be eligible.</p>
