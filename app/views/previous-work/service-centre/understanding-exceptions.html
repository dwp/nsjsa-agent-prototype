      <p>The goal of the system is to automate claims through to an appointment being needed to be booked.</p>
      <p>Automation isn't always possible though. We have to give any claims that can't be automated to an agent to be
        manually processed.</p>
      <p>These claims are called exceptions and they will drop into a bucket depending on the type of claim and what needs to
        happen to it.</p>
