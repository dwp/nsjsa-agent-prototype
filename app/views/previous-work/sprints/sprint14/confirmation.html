      <p>If you can get New Style JSA, we will let you know and set up a time to agree what you must do to look for work. We
        will discuss an agreement called a ‘Claimant Commitment’. We will contact you within the next 10 working&nbsp;days.</p>
      <p>The appointment will be with a work coach and will normally be over the&nbsp;phone.</p>
      <p>You must speak to the work coach and agree your Claimant Commitment before we can

      <p>If you're on a low income you might be able to apply for Universal Credit as part of a dual claim with New Style JSA.</p>
      <p>Unlike New Style JSA, you can apply with a partner and get support for housing costs, children and childcare.</p>
      <p>You or your partner must have less than £16,000 in savings or investments to be eligible.</p>
