                Problem statement
            </h2>
            <p>The current process to move a claim from the Contact Centre to the Service Centre involves many teams and several
                manual actions. These manual actions are time consuming and are at risk of user error and claim loss. They also increase
                the claim decision waiting time. Agents send sensitive claimant data by email and store it in SharePoint folders. This
                is a potential data security risk. The business does not have a full view of claim volumes at different stages of the
                process. This means it is challenging to identify where to prioritise resource.</p>
